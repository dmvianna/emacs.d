  ;; You may want to combine the `orderless` style with `substring` and/or `basic`.
  ;; There are many details to consider, but the following configurations all work well.
  ;; Personally I (@minad) use option 3 currently. Also note that you may want to configure
  ;; special styles for special completion categories, e.g., partial-completion for files.
  ;;
  ;; 1. (setq completion-styles '(orderless))
  ;; This configuration results in a very coherent completion experience,
  ;; since orderless is used always and exclusively. But it may not work
  ;; in all scenarios. Prefix expansion with TAB is not possible.
  ;;
  ;; 2. (setq completion-styles '(substring orderless))
  ;; By trying substring before orderless, TAB expansion is possible.
  ;; The downside is that you can observe the switch from substring to orderless
  ;; during completion, less coherent.
  ;;
  ;; 3. (setq completion-styles '(orderless basic))
  ;; Certain dynamic completion tables (completion-table-dynamic)
  ;; do not work properly with orderless. One can add basic as a fallback.
  ;; Basic will only be used when orderless fails, which happens only for
  ;; these special tables.
  ;;
  ;; 4. (setq completion-styles '(substring orderless basic))
  ;; Combine substring, orderless and basic.
