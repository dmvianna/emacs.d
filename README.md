That's my emacs configuration, reborn. Thanks to
[use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package),
[system-packages](https://gitlab.com/jabranham/system-packages) and
[elpaca](https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca). If you want to scale your configuration, you
can't go too wrong reading their `README.md`s prior to copy-pasting snippets
indiscriminately.
